      Hi! I'm faide, and I maintain the guardian druid analyzer.  Thanks for being here!<br /><br />

      The suggestions and statistics here are provided to give you an idea of how to improve your play, both defensively and offensively.  A great player can manage both aspects of the role, and both are important to being an effective tank.<br /><br />

      The guardian toolkit is big and diverse, and knowing every corner of it is the key to success.  The most important thing is to keep your hard-hitting, rage generating spells on cooldown at all times (<SpellLink id={SPELLS.THRASH_BEAR.id} />, <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MANGLE_BEAR.id} />, <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MOONFIRE.id} /> with <SpellLink id={SPELLS.GALACTIC_GUARDIAN_TALENT.id} />). Keep <SpellLink id={SPELLS.IRONFUR.id} /> up when you're tanking the boss, use <SpellLink id={SPELLS.FRENZIED_REGENERATION.id} /> when you're low or taking heavy damage, use <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BARKSKIN.id} /> and <SpellLink id={SPELLS.RAGE_OF_THE_SLEEPER.id} /> frequently to mitigate and deal loads of damage, and save <SpellLink id={SPELLS.SURVIVAL_INSTINCTS.id} /> for big hits.<br /><br />

      If you have any suggestions or feedback on the analyzer, check out the Github issue below.
